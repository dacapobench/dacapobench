# Need to turn off NMI watchdog
#
# When use 2400MT/s and JEDEC profile (no XMP)
# The motherboard sets timing to (tCL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS) 22-20-20-39
# But the machine is very unstable, and reboots in the middle of a h2 invocation
# When forcing XMP3 profile, the timing is 32-32-32-64 regardless the system memory multiplier
# and the machine can pass prime95 and memtest.
#
# Quick test: running -d runbms ./data ./memory.yml -s 2 -p "dacapo-memory"
# Full run: running runbms ./data ./memory.yml -s 2 -p "dacapo-memory"
