#
# This data summarizes GC logs gathered over 10 interations of the benchmark,
# for different heap sizes.  For each heap size, a list of tuples is given.
# Each tuple presents the start time (sec), the minimum heap size (MB),
# and the pause time (ms) for the respective GC.
#
# For example, the tuple [7.218, 16, 0.94] reports a GC that started at
# 7.218s into the program execution, that resulted in a post-GC heap size
# of 16MB, and that took 0.94ms.
#
# The heap sizes are reported as mulitples of the minimum heap size for the
# benchmkark (1.0 means 1.0 x the min heap).
#
# These results were gathered using the following DaCapo version:
#    dacapo-evaluation-git-6b469af0
#
# The following JVM was used:
#    Temurin-21.0.4+7
#
# Results were generated on the following platform:
#    AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16/32 4.5GHz cores, Linux 6.8.0-40
